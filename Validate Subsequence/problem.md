<h1>
Validate Subsequence
</h1>
<h3><b>
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
<br><br>
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4].
<br><br>
<p style="color:#ff0066">
Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
<br><br>

`Sample Input`
```swift
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10] 
```

`Sample Output`
```swift
true
```
